ErlMail is a complete email solution written in Erlang. It contains (or will contain) full RFC compliant SMTP, IMAP and POP clients and servers written in a modular fashion to allow others to use the modules in their own projects.

The message store for ErlMail is also modular so that anyone can create their own [message store](MessageStore.md) to accommodate how they would like the files to be stored in their own system.

ErlMail is part of the [Erlang Internet Framework](http://erlsoft.org/about/).
